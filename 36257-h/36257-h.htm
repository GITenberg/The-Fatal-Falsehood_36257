<tr><td align="left">
Our modern poets now can scarcely choose<br />
A subject worthy of the Tragic Muse;<br />
For bards so well have glean'd th' historic field,<br />
That scarce one sheaf th' exhausted ancients yield;<br />
Or if, perchance, they from the golden crop<br />
Some grains, with hand penurious, rarely drop;<br />
Our author these consigns to manly toil,<br />
For classic themes demand a classic soil,<br />
A vagrant she, the desert waste who chose,<br />
Where Truth and History no restraints impose.<br />
To her the wilds of fiction open lie,<br />
A flow'ry prospect, and a boundless sky;<br />
Yet hard the task to keep the onward way,<br />
Where the wide scenery lures the foot to stray;<br />
Where no severer limits check the Muse,<br />
Than lawless fancy is dispos'd to choose.<br />
<span class="ind1">Nor does she emulate the loftier strains</span><br />
Which high <i>heroic</i> Tragedy maintains:<br />
Nor conquests she, nor wars, nor triumphs sings,<br />
Nor with rash hand o'erturns the thrones of kings.<br />
No ruin'd empires greet to night your eyes,<br />
No nations at our bidding fall or rise;<br />
To statesmen deep, to politicians grave,<br />
These themes congenial to their tastes we leave.<br />
Of crowns and camps, a kingdom's weal or woe,<br />
How few can judge, because how few can know!<br />
But here you all may boast the censor's art;<br />
Here all are critics who possess a heart.<br />
Of the mix'd passions we display to-night,<br />
Each hearer judges like the Stagyrite.<br />
The scenes of private life our author shows,<br />
A simple story of domestic woes;<br />
Nor unimportant is the glass we hold,<br />
To show th' effect of passions uncontroll'd;<br />
To govern empires is the lot of few,<br />
But all who live have <i>passions</i> to subdue.<br />
Self-conquest is the lesson books should preach,<br />
Self-conquest is the theme the Stage should teach.<br />
Vouchsafe to learn this obvious duty here,<br />
The verse though feeble, yet the moral's clear.<br />
O mark to-night the unexampled woes<br />
Which from unbounded self-indulgence flows.<br />
Your candour once endur'd our author's lays,<br />
Endure them now&mdash;it will be ample praise.</td></tr>

I play a surer game, and screen my heart<br />
With easy looks and undesigning smiles;<br />
And while my plots still spring from sober thought,<br />
My deeds appear th' effect of wild caprice,<br />
And I the thoughtless slave of giddy chance.<br />
What but this frankness could have won the promise<br />
Of young Orlando, to confide to me<br />
That secret grief which preys upon his heart?<br />
'Tis shallow, indiscreet hypocrisy<br />
To seem too good: I am the <i>careless</i> Bertrand,<br />
The honest, undesigning, plain, blunt man.<br />
The follies I avow cloak those I hide;<br />
For who will search where nothing seems conceal'd?<br />
'Tis rogues of solid, prudent, grave demeanour<br />
Excite suspicion; men on whose dark brow<br />
Discretion, with his iron hand, has grav'd<br />
The deep-mark'd characters of thoughtfulness.<br />
Here comes my uncle, venerable Guildford,<br />
Whom I could honour, were he not the sire<br />
Of that aspiring boy, who fills the gap<br />

For there are follies in a young man's life,<br />
Vain schemes and thoughtless hours which I should blush<br />
To lay before your wise and temperate age.</p></td></tr>

And I should be asham'd could I forget<br />
I have myself been young, and harshly chide<br />
This not ungraceful gaiety. Yes, Bertrand,<br />
Prudence becomes moroseness, when it makes<br />
A rigid inquisition of the fault,<br />
Not of the man, perhaps, but of his youth.<br />
Foibles that shame the head on which old Time<br />
Has shower'd his snow are then more pardonable,<br />
And age has many a weakness of its own.</p></td></tr>

Correct the wand'rings of misguided youth,<br />
More than rebuke, and shame me into virtue.</p></td></tr>

For scarce is Emmelina more belov'd<br />
Than Julia, the dear child of my adoption.<br />
The hour approaches too, (and bless it, heav'n,<br />
With thy benignest kindliest influence!)<br />
When Julia shall indeed become my daughter,<br />
Shall, in obedience to her father's will,<br />
Crown the impatient vows of my brave son,<br />
And richly pay him for his dangers past.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td align="left"><p><i>Ber.</i> Oft have I wonder'd how the gallant Rivers,<br />
Youthful and ardent, doting to excess,<br />
Could dare the dangers of uncertain war,<br />
Ere marriage had confirm'd his claim to Julia.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td align="left"><p><i>Guild.</i> 'Twas the condition of her father's will,<br />
My brave old fellow-soldier, and my friend!<br />
He wish'd to see our ancient houses join'd<br />
By this, our children's union; but the veteran<br />
So highly valued military prowess,<br />
That he bequeath'd his fortunes and his daughter<br />
To my young Rivers, on these terms alone,<br />
That he should early gain renown in arms;<br />
And if he from the field return'd a conqueror,<br />
That sun which saw him come victorious home<br />
Should witness their espousals. Yet he comes not!<br />
The event of war is to the brave uncertain,<br />
Nor can desert in arms ensure success.</p></td></tr>

My Rivers' bosom friend, has been my guest,<br />
The glory of my son is all his theme:<br />

The praises he bestows.</p></td></tr>

But why does young Orlando shun my presence?<br />
Why lose that cheerful and becoming spirit<br />

Should he return, and find his friend unhappy.<br />
He is not what he was. What says my child?</p></td></tr>

Came from that voyage, he kindly undertook<br />
To ease our terrors for my Rivers' safety,<br />
When we believ'd him dead; he seem'd most happy,<br />
And shar'd the gen'ral joy his presence gave.<br />
Of late he is less gay; my brother's absence<br />
(Or I mistake) disturbs his friend's repose:<br />
Nor is it strange; one mind informs them both;<br />
Each is the very soul that warms the other,<br />
And both are wretched, or are bless'd together.</p></td></tr>

The law of Liberty and Wit they seize;<br />
In Tragic&mdash;Comic&mdash;Pastoral&mdash;they dare to please.<br />
Each puny Bard must surely burst with spite,<br />

Her gods, her cook, her milliner and muse,<br />

The virgin Nine in terror fly the bower,<br />
And matron Juno claims despotic power;<br />
Soon Gothic hags the classic pile o'erturn,<br />
A caudle-cup supplants the sacred urn;<br />
Nor books, nor implements escape their rage,<br />
They spike the ink-stand, and they rend the page;<br />
Poems and plays one barbarous fate partake,<br />
Ovid and Plautus suffer at the stake,<br />
And Aristotle's only sav'd&mdash;to wrap plum-cake.<br />
<span class="ind1">Yet, shall a woman tempt the tragic scene?</span><br />
And dare&mdash;but hold&mdash;I must repress my spleen;<br />
I see your hearts are pledg'd to her applause,<br />

Well pleas'd to aid&mdash;since o'er his sacred bier<br />
A female hand did ample trophies rear,<br />

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
